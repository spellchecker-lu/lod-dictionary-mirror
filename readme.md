This mirror is meant to facilitate the access to the data from the "Lëtzebuerger Online Dictionnaire" because they only provides a single XML file (> 1GB in size) with all the content (including audio data).
The mirror is maintained by Guillaume Rischard (@grischard), Edson Souza Morais (@edson-souza-morais) and Michel Weimerskirch (@mweimerskirch).
We try to keep the mirror always up to date, but can not give any guarantees as to the correctness of the transformations and the reliability of the transformation scripts.

If you have any suggestions about the structure, feel free to create an issue or pull request.
Apart from that, the repo is read only and any issues or enhancement requests should be sent to the LOD team: https://data.public.lu/fr/datasets/letzebuerger-online-dictionnaire-raw-data/

The scripts that we use to split the files into multiple parts can be found in a separate repository: https://github.com/spellchecker-lu/lod-dictionary-tools
